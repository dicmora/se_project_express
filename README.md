# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project implements the back-end server for the WTWR application, providing a RESTful API with user authorization. It supports operations for users and clothing items, including creating, reading, deleting, and liking/unliking items. The server uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with Mongoose for database interaction. ESLint and Prettier ensure code quality, while centralized error handling manages HTTP responses (400, 404, 500). The backend enables the front-end to interact with a secure, fully functional

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 15
