# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project implements the back-end server for the WTWR application, providing a RESTful API with user authorization. It supports operations for users and clothing items, including creating, reading, deleting, and liking/unliking items.

The backend enables the front-end to interact with a secure, fully functional

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
